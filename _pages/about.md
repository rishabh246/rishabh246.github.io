I am an Assistant Professor in the [Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) department at [UC Berkeley](https://berkeley.edu/).
Prior to joining Berkeley, I completed my PhD at EPFL in Switzerland and my bachelor's degree at IIT Bombay.

I am a **computer systems** researcher, and my work draws on insights from a broad set of domains, including operating systems, networking, computer architecture, and, more recently, AI.
My work has received several awards, including the [ACM SIGOPS Dennis M. Ritchie Award](https://www.sigops.org/awards/dmr/), the [Eurosys Roger Needham PhD Award](https://www.eurosys.org/awards/roger-needham-phd-award), and the [Dimitris N. Chorafas Award](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/feinberg/about/dimitris-n-chorafas-prize/about-foundation-and-prize). More details can be found in my [CV](files/rishabh-cv.pdf).

  <strong>I am actively looking for talented and ambitious students to join my group!</strong> For students already at Berkeley, the best way to contact me is via <a href="mailto:rishabh.iyer@berkeley.edu">email</a>. For students seeking to join Berkeley, please refer to the <a href="https://eecs.berkeley.edu/academics/graduate/research-programs/admissions/">Berkeley EECS Graduate Admissions page</a> and mention my name on your application. I will be hiring several PhD students in the upcoming admissions cycle (2025-26).

Active Research Directions

Below are a few of my ongoing research directions. A full list of my publications can be found [here](/publications).

    <strong> Systems Support for Learned Policies:</strong>
What systems support is needed for agents to efficiently learn new system heuristics across a variety of domains?
We're currently focusing on building fast, high-fidelity simulators that allow agents to rapidly iterate over candidate solutions.

    <strong> Designing an AI-Native System Stack:</strong>
What does an AI-native system stack that supports dynamic, agent-driven optimization by default look like?
We're exploring this question across multiple layers of the system stack; from CPU hardware to OS schedulers to distributed systems for AI.

    <strong> Fast, Flexible, and Practical OS Kernel Extensions:</strong>
Given that the Linux is increasingly becoming an eBPF-powered microkernel, what programming model best supports safe and expressive kernel extensions? Can these extensions go beyond policy tweaks and enable architectural redesigns of the kernel itself?

    <strong> Building Robust and Provably Correct Networked Systems:</strong>
As systems scale exponentially and become increasingly tightly-coupled, can we design pro-active mechanisms for ensuring reliability in the face of failures? How should we best combine formal and semi-formal methods to design such mechanisms?
