I am a postdoc working with [Sylvia Ratnasamy](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sylvia/) and [Scott Shenker](http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/icsi/people/shenker) in the [NetSys Lab](https://netsys.cs.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley. I recently (February 2024) graduated from EPFL, after completing my PhD under the supervision of [Professor George Candea](http://dslab.epfl.ch/people/candea/) and [Professor Katerina Argyraki](https://people.epfl.ch/katerina.argyraki?lang=en). Prior to joining EPFL,  I received a B.Tech degree in Electrical Engineering from IIT Bombay in 2017.. Prior to joining EPFL, I received a B.Tech degree in Electrical Engineering from IIT Bombay in 2017.

My research interests lie primarily in the fields of Computer Systems, Networking and Architecture and I like to tinker with formal verification tools. My current research is centered around developing systems and techniques that enable developers to reason precisely about the performance behavior of their code _before_ it is deployed. My [dissertation work](/files/thesis.pdf) introduced the notion of latency interfaces---simple, succinct programs that summarize a systemâ€™s latency behavior just
like semantic interfaces such as code documentation and specifications summarize functionality---and was awarded the 2023 [ACM SIGOPS Dennis M. Ritchie Award](https://www.sigops.org/awards/dmr/) for "the best PhD. Thesis in Computer Systems".

Here is my [CV](/files/cv.pdf) (updated March 2024).
